# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to llm-d. Community involvement is highly valued and crucial for the project's growth and success. The llm-d project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

To ensure a clear direction and cohesive vision for the project, the project leads have the final decision on all contributions. However, these guidelines outline how you can contribute effectively to llm-d.

* **Suggesting Features:** Share your ideas for new features or improvements.
* **Improving Documentation:** Help make the project more accessible by enhancing the documentation.
* **Submitting Code Contributions (with consideration):** While the project leads maintain final say, code contributions that align with the project's vision are always welcome.

## Reporting Issues

Before submitting a new issue, please:

* **Check Existing Issues:** Search the issue tracker to see if a similar issue has already been reported.
* **Be Clear and Concise:** Provide a descriptive title and detailed steps to reproduce the issue. Include your operating system, relevant software versions, and any error messages.

Pull requests for documentation improvements are welcome.

## Submitting Code Contributions

The process for accepting code contributions is as follows:

1.  **Discuss First (Recommended):** For significant changes or new features, it's highly recommended to open an issue first to discuss in the community. This helps ensure your effort aligns with the project's goals and avoids potential rework.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the relevant llm-d repository.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a dedicated branch within your fork.
4.  **Follow Coding Standards:** Adhere to any existing coding style or conventions used in the project.
5.  **Write Tests (if applicable):** If your contribution includes code changes, please include relevant tests.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request to the main repository. Clearly describe the changes you've made and why.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by the lead core Maintainer. Feedback will be provided, and you may be asked to make revisions. The project leads will ultimately decide whether to merge the pull request based on its alignment with the project's vision, code quality, and overall impact.
