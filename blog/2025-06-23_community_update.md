# **llm-d Community Update**

Hey everyone! We've been making great progress with the llm-d project, and I wanted to share some important updates and opportunities to get involved.

## Help Shape Our Performance Benchmarks

The SIG-Benchmarking team is working on documenting real-world use cases and establishing performance expectations for llm-d deployments. To make this as comprehensive as possible, we need your help!  

This survey is being conducted by researchers within Red Hat AI to better understand how organizations are evaluating, deploying, and monitoring GenAI applications in production environments. Your responses will help inform open research, tooling improvements, and best practices for the broader AI community.

:::tip Share Your Use Case
We've created a [Use Case Survey Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefWpxlGNMN0NAj_4TzVLfSwTCyAz0gndNtLwoS9mamg5DtXw/viewform) to gather information about your LLM workloads. This will help us:
- Document common deployment patterns
- Establish realistic performance baselines
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Guide future development priorities
:::

Your input is invaluable in helping us understand:
- What models you're deploying
- Your workload characteristics (input/output lengths, request patterns)
- Performance requirements and constraints
- Current challenges and pain points

The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. All responses are confidential and will be used in aggregated, anonymized form only.

As a thank-you, you'll be entered into a raffle to win a pair of Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) upon submission.
