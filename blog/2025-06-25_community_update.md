Hey everyone! We've been making great progress with the llm-d project, and I wanted to share some important updates and opportunities to get involved.

## Help Shape the Future of the llm-d Project

To guide the future development of the llm-d project, we need to understand the real-world challenges, configurations, and performance needs of our community. We've created a short survey to gather insight into how you serve Large Language Models, from the hardware you use to the features you need most.

This **anonymous**, vendor-agnostic survey will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Your input will directly influence the project's roadmap and priorities. The aggregated results will be shared with the [llm-d-contributors](https://groups.google.com/g/llm-d-contributors) mailing list to benefit the entire community.

:::tip Your Input Will Define Our Roadmap
We've created an [llm-d Community Roadmap Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScENfBNrN1q8XpugCmDUjy8sSn1cMzi_V0mCWTRwzixcPAQkw/viewform) to gather information about your LLM workloads. We are looking to learn more about:

* **Your Serving Environment:** This includes the hardware you use now and anticipate using in a year (like NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, or CPUs), and whether you run on-premise, in the cloud, or on edge devices.
* **Your Model Strategy:** Do you serve a few large models or many smaller ones, which model families (like Llama or Mistral) are most common, and how you utilize techniques like LoRA adapters.
* **Your Performance Requirements:** Your real-world SLOs for latency and throughput and the biggest LLM serving challenges you faceâ€”from cost optimization to operational ease of use.
* **Your Future Needs:** What single new feature you would prioritize for an LLM Model-as-a-Service to help guide our innovation.

### [Take the 5-Minute Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScENfBNrN1q8XpugCmDUjy8sSn1cMzi_V0mCWTRwzixcPAQkw/viewform)

**Your participation is invaluable.** Please take a few minutes to complete the survey. We encourage you to share it with other users or proxy their needs in your response to ensure our direction reflects the community's diverse requirements.
