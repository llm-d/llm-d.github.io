# **Red Hat Launches the llm-d Community, Powering Distributed Gen AI Inference at Scale**

 Forged in collaboration with founding contributors CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research and NVIDIA and joined by industry leaders AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda and Mistral AI and university supporters at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, the project aims to make production generative AI as omnipresent as Linux

**BOSTON – RED HAT SUMMIT – MAY 20, 2025 —** Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the launch of llm-d, a new open source project that answers the most crucial need of generative AI’s (gen AI) future: Inference at scale. Tapping breakthrough inference technologies for gen AI at scale, llm-d is powered by a native Kubernetes architecture, vLLM-based distributed inference and intelligent AI-aware network routing, empowering robust, large language model (LLM) inference clouds to meet the most demanding production service-level objectives (SLOs).

While training remains vital, the true impact of gen AI hinges on more efficient and scalable inference \- the engine that transforms AI models into actionable insights and user experiences. According to Gartner[^1], “By 2028, as the market matures, more than 80% of data center workload accelerators will be specifically deployed for inference as opposed to training use.” This underscores that the future of gen AI lies in the ability to execute. The escalating resource demands of increasingly sophisticated and larger reasoning models limits the viability of centralized inference and threatens to bottleneck AI innovation with prohibitive costs and crippling latency.

### Answering the need for scalable gen AI inference with llm-d

Red Hat and its industry partners are directly confronting this challenge with llm-d, a visionary project that amplifies the power of vLLM to transcend single-server limitations and unlock production at scale for AI inference. Using the proven orchestration prowess of Kubernetes, llm-d integrates advanced inference capabilities into existing enterprise IT infrastructures. This unified platform empowers IT teams to meet the diverse serving demands of business-critical workloads, all while deploying innovative techniques to maximize efficiency and dramatically minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) associated with high-performance AI accelerators.

llm-d delivers a powerful suite of innovations, highlighted by:

* **vLLM**, which has quickly become the open source de facto standard inference server, providing day 0 model support for emerging frontier models, and support for a broad list of accelerators, now including Google Cloud Tensor Processor Units (TPUs).   
* **Prefill and Decode Disaggregation** to separate the input context and token generation phases of AI into discrete operations, where they can then be distributed across multiple servers.  
* **KV (key-value) Cache Offloading**, based on LMCache, shifts the memory burden of the KV cache from GPU memory to more cost-efficient and abundant standard storage, like CPU memory or network storage.  
* **Kubernetes-powered clusters and controllers** for more efficient scheduling of compute and storage resources as workload demands fluctuate, while maintaining performance and lower latency.  
* **AI-Aware Network Routing** for scheduling incoming requests to the servers and accelerators that are most likely to have hot caches of past inference calculations.  
* **High-performance communication APIs** for faster and more efficient data transfer between servers, with support for NVIDIA Inference Xfer Library (NIXL).

### llm-d: Backed by industry leaders 

This new open source project has already garnered the support of a formidable coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerator pioneers, and premier AI cloud platforms. CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research and NVIDIA are founding contributors, with AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda and Mistral AI as partners, underscoring the industry’s deep collaboration to architect the future of large-scale LLM serving. The llm-d community is further joined by founding supporters at the Sky Computing Lab at the University of California, originators of vLLM, and the LMCache Lab at the University of Chicago, originators of [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache)*.*

Rooted in its unwavering commitment to open collaboration, Red Hat recognizes the critical importance of vibrant and accessible communities in the rapidly evolving landscape of gen AI inference. Red Hat will actively champion the growth of the llm-d community, fostering an inclusive environment for new members and fueling its continued evolution.

### Red Hat’s vision: Any model, any accelerator, any cloud.

The future of AI must be defined by limitless opportunity, not constrained by infrastructure silos. Red Hat sees a horizon where organizations can deploy any model, on any accelerator, across any cloud, delivering an exceptional, more consistent user experience without exorbitant costs. To unlock the true potential of gen AI investments, enterprises require a universal inference platform \- a standard for more seamless, high-performance AI innovation, both today and in the years to come.

Just as Red Hat pioneered the open enterprise by transforming Linux into the bedrock of modern IT, the company is now poised to architect the future of AI inference. vLLM’s potential is that of a linchpin for standardized gen AI inference, and Red Hat is committed to building a thriving ecosystem around not just the vLLM community but also llm-d for distributed inference at scale. The vision is clear: regardless of the AI model or the underlying accelerator or the deployment environment, Red Hat intends to make vLLM the definitive open standard for inference across the new hybrid cloud.
