# llm-d Website Repository

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The site may be previewed at [llm-d.github.io](https://llm-d.github.io/) before it goes live

If you spot any errors or ommisions in the site, please open an issue at [github.com/llm-d/llm-d.github.io](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d.github.io/issues)

## BEFORE DOING A PULL REQUEST

1. Make sure you are familiar with how docusaurus builds menus and links to images
2. Make sure there are no relative links to any of the llm-d component repositories in your markdown. 
3. Fork the website repo and deploy a preview version of your proposed change for reviewers to check. This will make obvious any missed links from step 2
    

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```
